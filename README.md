The Linux Compromise Assessment - APT Attack Investigation examines the IronShade APT groupâ€™s attack on a Linux server, uncovering backdoor accounts, hidden services, brute-force attacks, and persistence mechanisms. The auth.log reveals failed SSH login attempts from 10.11.75.247, indicating a brute-force attack: Aug 6 01:16:43 cybertees sshd[2256]: Failed password for mircoservice from 10.11.75.247 port 54649 ssh2. However, successful logins confirm the compromise: Aug 5 22:10:40 cybertees sshd[2115]: Accepted password for mircoservice from 10.11.75.247 port 56660 ssh2. The attacker created a backdoor account: Aug 5 22:05:33 cybertees useradd[2067]: new user: name=mircoservice, UID=1001, GID=1001, home=/home/mircoservice, shell=/bin/bash. Persistence was established via systemd services and cron jobs: @reboot /home/mircoservice/printer_app, strokes.service:ExecStart=/home/mircoservice/.tmp/.strokes. Suspicious hidden files in /root, such as .systmd, suggest malware. The dpkg.log shows unauthorized package installations, likely exploiting CUPS: 2024-06-26 06:41:06 status installed cups-server-common:all 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7. Investigation involved SSH log analysis, detecting brute-force attempts, uncovering malicious services, and APT research. Mitigation includes removing mircoservice, disabling rogue services, auditing /root files, and restricting SSH access.
